# Learning sciter using Linux and CMake

This repo contains sciter tutorials / projects that should compile on linux with the CMake buildsystem.

Sciter (https://sciter.com) is a very lightweitght web technology stack for desktop UI development. It essentially does what electron (NodeJS) does and more,
but without the >100MB file size. Sciter apps are very compact (about 5-10 MB).
